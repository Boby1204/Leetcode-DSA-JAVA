A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student in line.

You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed).

Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i

class Solution {
    public int heightChecker(int[] heights) {
        int n = heights.length;
        int count = 0;
        int expected[] = new int[n];
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            expected[i] = heights[i];
        }
        Arrays.sort(heights);
        for(int i = 0;i<n;i++){
            if(heights[i] != expected[i]){
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
