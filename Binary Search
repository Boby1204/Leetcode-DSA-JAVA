Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

class Solution {
    public int search(int[] arr, int target) {
        // l is start and r is end of array
        //calculate mid
        //move l and r based on comparision of arr[mid] and target
        int l = 0;
        int r = arr.length - 1;
        int mid;
        while(l <= r){
            mid = (l + r)/2;
            if(arr[mid] == target)
                return mid;
            else if(arr[mid] > target){
                r = mid - 1;
            }
            else if(arr[mid] < target)
                l = mid + 1;
        }
        // l>r
        return -1;
    }
}
