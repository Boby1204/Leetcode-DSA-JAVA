Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

 class Solution {
  public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
    int ones = 0;
    int twos = 0;

    for (final int num : nums) {
      ones ^= (num & ~twos);
      twos ^= (num & ~ones);
    }

    return ones;
  }
}
